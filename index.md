### <span style="color:royalBlue;font-weight:bold">Biography</span>

I am a first-year Ph.D. student at CS Department, Florida State University, under the supervision of Prof. [Guang Wang](http://guangwang.me/#/home). 
<br>I am also working with Prof. [Desheng Zhang](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~dz220/) in research. I obtained my bachelor's degree and master's degree both <br>from Southeast University (China).

My research interests are broadly in the areas of **Cyber-Physical Systems**, **Human-Centered Computing**, and **Trustworthy Decision-making Applications**. You can contact me at lj23d AT fsu DOT edu.

My publications can also be found at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=G66TbJYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).
