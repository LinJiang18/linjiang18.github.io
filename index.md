### <span style="color:royalBlue;font-weight:bold">Biography</span>

I am a  Ph.D. student at CS Department, Florida State University, under the supervision of Prof. [Guang Wang](http://guangwang.me/#/home). I obtained my bachelor's degree and master's degree both from Southeast University (China).

I have a strong interest in both generation and decision-making.
My current research focuses on **task-oriented data generation for downstream applications** and **trustworthy decision-making systems**. I am also open to collaborations in new directions. 
You can contact me at lin.jiang@fsu.edu.

My publications can also be found at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=G66TbJYAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).
